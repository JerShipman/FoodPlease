# FoodPlease
A quick python program that helps me decide what I am going to eat for diner.
I made this because I am always fighting with significant other about what we are going to eat.
Currently, I am making an iOS in swift based off this project for my senior project. This is a link to that project [Foodie](https://github.com/JerShipman/Foodie)...just know I am still working on it and it will be complete soon!

## How to use
There are four main files. 
* FoodPlease_CommandLine.py (*main is located here*)
* fileManager.py
* inchoices.txt (*choices of food you would make*)
* outchoices.txt (*choices of takeout*)

*The txt files are to save items and come preloaded with some of my favorite choices.*
You start the application up from FoodPlease_CommandLine.py and select if you want to edit your menus or if you want to go ahead and pick a random choice from inchoices or outchoices

### Legacy folder 
If you want to see how sad the project started feel free to click into the legacy folder...Thankfully it looks much cleaner now.
